### Hi there 👋

My journey began with curiosity-driven experiments in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **computer vision**. Over time, it evolved into building full-stack systems using **Python (FastAPI)** and **Vue.js** (first Quasar then Nuxt) — blending logic, structure, and a bit of storytelling.

Professionally I work with **PHP (Laravel)** and **Java (Spring Boot)**, and I bring that experience into my Python projects — especially when designing architecture, managing async workflows, and applying backend best practices.
